    <h1>My Work Experience</h1>
    <p>I've been working since I was 12 starting as member on a <b>junior advisory board</b> for a family bank and I am still a member of the board helping make decisions to help better the bank. Ever since I was 12, I have worked jobs washing cars to joining the militray. But with every new job I've taken on I feel it has only helped me grow as a person.</p>
